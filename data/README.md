# Data

Due to the sensitive nature of the data, we took deliberate steps to comply
with the terms of the restricted dataset provided by the HCP. More importantly, we carefully
designed the analysis to protect the privacy of HCP subjects. Robust data transformations and filtering were performed during preprocessing, and these methods
are detailed in Section 2 of the report. We specifically must avoid providing data that could lead to identifiability
on the individual level. To ensure anonymity, we implemented various redaction and
randomization techniques. For the trait data, sensitive behavioral traits, such as substance use
and psychiatric well-being, are reported at the individual level. We used the synthpop package
in R to create synthetic data based on the distributions of raw behavioral traits. Additionally,
we removed the trait names, reordered them randomly, and assigned unidentifiable numbers. The
specific arguments and methods used in synthpop are not disclosed to prevent traceability.
For the brain region data, identifiability is already reduced through PCA, requiring minimal
additional anonymization. To further mitigate the risk of reverse engineering, we did not report
specific loadings for each subject, rather we again created synthetic data. For both sample datasets,
subject identifiers were removed, and the rows were arranged in a disclosed random order. The
sample data is provided in an .Rdata file on GitHub, located in data\Sample Data.Rdata.

TIndicies for the brain regions from from the Desikan Parcellation

### `Details_175_Traits.xlsx`
This file contains details of the 175 traits considered in the begninig of our analysis before preprocessing. Traits are measures of a personâ€™s cognition, substance use, psychiatric and life function, sensory, emotion, health and family history.

### `Sample_Data.RData`
An `.RData` file that contains the synthetic data generated for the traits and PCA loadings, along with the true PCA matrix found during our analysis.
